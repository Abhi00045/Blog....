# MLP-DRIVEN MALARIA DISEASE OUTBREAK ANALYSIS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DATA FOR PUBLIC HEALTHÂ MANAGEMENT

## Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. This project aims to develop a predictive model for malaria incidence using machine learning techniques, aiding in early detection and intervention strategies.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Aggregates data from multiple sources such as meteorological data, health records, and demographic information.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and performs feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict malaria incidence based on input features.
- **Visualization**: Generates charts and maps to visualize predicted malaria hotspots and trends.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Malaria-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Malaria-Prediction
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the data**: Ensure all necessary datasets are in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run data preprocessing**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. **Make predictions**:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Dataset

The model relies on the following datasets:

- **Climate Data**: Temperature, precipitation, and humidity levels.
- **Historical Malaria Cases**: Records of reported malaria incidents over time.
- **Demographic Data**: Population density, age distribution, and other relevant factors.

*Note*: Ensure compliance with data usage policies and obtain necessary permissions before using any datasets.

## Model

The predictive model employs a machine learning algorithm to forecast malaria cases. The model is trained using historical malaria case data and environmental factors.

## Results

Upon training, the model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Short-term predictions (1-2 weeks ahead)**: High correlation with actual malaria cases.
- **Medium-term predictions (up to 16 weeks ahead)**: Reliable accuracy for forecasting outbreaks.
