Malaria Prediction
Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Despite significant progress in reducing malaria incidence, it remains a major public health concern, particularly in tropical regions. Accurate prediction models can aid in early detection and effective intervention strategies.

Project Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model for malaria incidence using various data sources, including climate variables, historical malaria cases, and other relevant factors. By analyzing these data, the model seeks to forecast malaria outbreaks, enabling healthcare providers and policymakers to implement timely preventive measures.

Features
Data Collection: Aggregates data from multiple sources such as meteorological data, health records, and demographic information.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and performs feature engineering to enhance model performance.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict malaria incidence based on input features.
Visualization: Generates charts and maps to visualize predicted malaria hotspots and trends.

Dataset
The model relies on the following datasets:

Climate Data: Temperature, precipitation, and humidity levels.
Historical Malaria Cases: Records of reported malaria incidents over time.
Demographic Data: Population density, age distribution, and other relevant factors.
Note: Ensure compliance with data usage policies and obtain necessary permissions before using any datasets.

Model
The predictive model employs a time series distributed lag nonlinear model, which has been shown to perform well for short-term malaria predictions. For instance, a study conducted in Vhembe, Limpopo, South Africa, demonstrated that such a model could accurately forecast malaria cases up to 16 weeks ahead

Results
Upon training, the model achieved the following performance metrics:

Short-term predictions (1-2 weeks ahead): Correlation coefficient (r) > 0.8
Medium-term predictions (up to 16 weeks ahead): Correlation coefficient (r) > 0.7
These results are consistent with findings from previous research, indicating the model's robustness in forecasting malaria incidence
